code prior to submitting a pull request.

## Best Practices

Prior to submitting a pull request, please be sure to:

* Write unit tests where applicable
* Make sure existing unit tests pass before submitting a pull request
* Write a descriptive commit message. [See the following guide](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* If applicable, increment the version number according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
* If you have multiple commits in your PR, you should squash all your commits into a single commit. [See the following guide](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git).
